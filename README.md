3. Simulate a dataset for Classification with 3 Labels, 6 attributes with interaction among them,
10000 instances and use Uniform random function
4. Simulate a dataset for regression 6 attributes with interaction among them, 10000 instances and
use normal random function
5. Simulate a dataset for Clustering 6 attributes with interaction among them, 10000 instances and
use normal random function.
6. Build a Non Linear Regression model and get 90% Accuracy for the above simulated data in
question2. Split the data into 70% and 30% respectively for Training and Testing for model
building
7. Build any five Classifiers for the above dataset in question1 and compare the metrics of these built
models. Metrics need to build are Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1Score. Split the data into 70%
and 30% respectively for Training and Testing for model building
8. Load CSV, EXCEL, EXCELS, JSON format datasets from local host and Websites into Colab
interface and split them into Train and test data.
9. Load different datasets from SkLearn library into Colab interface and split them into train and
test data. Apply Normalization techniques to convert input data into standardize.
10. Load any data from website/Local host and apply the below data wrangling techniques
a. Split b) merge c) select rows by conditions d) select columns by conditions e) Rename
columns f) Min, max, avg, varience g) describe h) size I) shape j) find unique values k)
find missing values and fill them with average value/ mode value l) replace attribute
value name with other name m)delete columns n) delete some rows o) join datasets(left,
right) p) groups values by rows q) loop over columns r) group rows by time s)
concatenating datasets t) append rows u)append columns w) reorder columns using
pandas lib
11. Load the Images and audio files. Covert audio file into spectrogram. Apply it for a length of one
minute telugu song. Convert a colour image into gray scale image.
12. Load any numeric data and apply Ridge and Lasso regressions to get 90% accuracy
13. Load Digits dataset and apply clustering models to get its metrics
14. Implement the techniques to handle imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset with binary class data
15. Apply KNN classifier on appropriate data. Find best neighbourhood size, Indices of
neighbourhood, distances of neighbourhood by taking a random new tuple.
16. Find support vectors and their probabilities by applying SVM on any binary classification dataset.
Also find the best model to generate support vectors. Get the metrics for this trained model.
Represent its graph also.
17. Load a mixed type features data and apply appropriate model. Predict class for any new tuple and
its probabilities.
